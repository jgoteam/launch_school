=begin
  - keyword 'modify'; `uniq` does not modify the object! Not uniq!
  - ! or ? at the end is not Ruby syntax, it is part of the method name
  - ! before turns an object into a boolean, with the value being opposite of the original value if it were a bool
    - !! is `!` twice, double negative, returns the boolean object equivalent to the original value of the object

  cover and include
  --cover method is checking whether object is between the endpoints,
    whereas include? is checking if the object is an element in that range
  --cover is basing it off the edges, include? is not

  Review hash assoc method, specifics of flatten
