# definitions
definitions: "--Definitions--\n
Principal\n
\tThe principal is the amount of a mortgage loan that you have to pay back.\n
\tYour monthly payment includes a portion of that principal.\n
\tWhen a payment on the principal is made, the borrower owes less, and will pay less interest based upon a lower loan size.\n
\n
Interest rate\n
\tAn interest rate on a mortgage loan is the cost you will pay each year to borrow the money, expressed as a percentage rate.\n
\tIt does not reflect fees or any other charges you may have to pay for the loan. \n
\n
APR vs APY\n
\tAPR does not take into account the compounding of interest within a specific year. \n
\tAPR is calculated as follows:\n
\t\tAPR = Periodic Rate x Number of Periods in a Year\n

\tUnlike APR, APY does take into account the frequency with which the interest is appliedâ€”the effects of intra-year compounding.\n
\tHere's how APY is calculated:\n
\t\tAPY = (1 + Periodic Rate)^(Number of periods) - 1\n
